To scale your PNG sequence to a specific resolution (500 x 1000 px) while converting to WebM, you can include the `scale` filter directly in the same FFmpeg command. The `scale` filter allows you to resize the images to the desired dimensions before encoding them into a WebM file. Iâ€™ve updated your documentation accordingly to include this step.

### **Updated Documentation for PNG Sequence to WebM with Scaling**

### **Step 1: Install FFmpeg via Homebrew**
With Homebrew installed, you can now install FFmpeg. In your terminal, run:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

This will download and install FFmpeg along with all necessary dependencies. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

## **3. Converting PNG Sequence to WebM with Transparency and Scaling**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your PNG Sequence**
Ensure your PNG files are named sequentially, like `PNG_0001.png`, `PNG_0002.png`, etc.

### **Step 2: Convert PNG Sequence to WebM and Scale the Output**
To convert a sequence of PNG files named `PNG_0001.png`, `PNG_0002.png`, etc., into a WebM video with transparency and scale it to 500 x 1000 px, you can use the `scale` filter in FFmpeg.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i PNG_%04d.png -vf "scale=500:1000" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p output.webm
```

- `-framerate 30`: Sets the frame rate to 30 frames per second. Adjust this if your animation has a different frame rate.
- `PNG_%04d.png`: The `%04d` placeholder matches the four-digit number in your file names (`0001`, `0002`, etc.), with `PNG_` being the prefix. Modify this pattern if your filenames have a different format.
- `-vf "scale=500:1000"`: This applies the scale filter to resize the images to 500 pixels wide by 1000 pixels tall.
- `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Specifies the VP9 codec, which supports transparency.
- `-pix_fmt yuva420p`: Ensures that the alpha channel (transparency) is preserved.
- `output.webm`: The desired name of the WebM output file.

### **Example:**
```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i PNG_%04d.png -vf "scale=500:1000" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p animation.webm
```

This command will take your PNG sequence, scale it to 500 x 1000 pixels, and convert it into a WebM video at 24 frames per second, preserving transparency.

### **Embedding the WebM Video in a Website**

Once you have your WebM file, you can embed it in your website using the following HTML code:

```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="path-to-your-video.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

Replace `path-to-your-video.webm` with the actual path to your WebM file.
